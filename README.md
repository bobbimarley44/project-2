# Project 2: Dead Namerator

I wanted to make a simple extension that would replace a person's dead name and
pronouns with their actual name and pronouns. There are many trans kids out
there who may be unable to change their legal name or to come out at all, and
have to look at their dead name whenever they access school or medical records.
Though there are already a few examples of this kind of extension available, I
wanted to add in a pronoun replacement as well, which I didn't see in other
extensions.
